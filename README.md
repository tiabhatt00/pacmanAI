# PacmanAI
UC Berkeley: The Pac-Man Projects

These projects cover informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning, providing a foundation for understanding real-world AI applications in fields like natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

Projects Overview
Search: Implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* algorithms to solve navigation problems in Pac-Man.
Multi-Agent Search: Model Pac-Man as adversarial and stochastic search problems, implementing minimax and expectimax algorithms with custom evaluation functions.
Reinforcement Learning: Apply model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms to Pac-Man, Gridworld, and a simulated crawling robot.
Ghostbusters: Use probabilistic inference with hidden Markov models to track hidden ghosts in Pac-Man, implementing exact and approximate inference techniques.
Classification: Implement Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and MIRA algorithms for digit classification and create a behavioral cloning Pac-Man agent.
